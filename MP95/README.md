Changes done:
1. Added new `BlogPost` model in `blog/models.py` for blogpost objects.
2. Added code to register the `BlogPost` model in the admin site.
3. Added the commands learnt from the post in the `shell_cmds.py`.
4. Going to push the db for now. Need to figure out a way to use the same db across branches without pushing to github.
